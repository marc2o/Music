An example of creating sounds and music with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/).

The oscillator code is based on the [Denver Synthesizer Library](https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=79499) and the MML parser is a changed and extended version of the one used in [love-mml](https://github.com/GoonHouse/love-mml).
